This is Sargon II Chess for the Commodore VIC-20 relocated to RAM ($2000) so that it can be played from a RAM expansion cartridge (minimum 8 KB).

Game functionality, openings table, bugs (shifted intro screen?), etc. are preserved as in the original.

The only change is that `RESTORE` will bring you to the intro screen in addition to the original combination (`RUN/STOP` + `RESTORE`).
